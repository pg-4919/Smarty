After almost two years of service, at long last, Smarty is going into retirement.
Over the years, one index.js file has, like a human infant, grown into an ailing old man who does what he does out of spite and hatred.
Anyways I spent a lot of time polishing Smarty, I don't think I'll ever be able to do something like this again.

## Config ##
```
{
    "token": "<token>",
    "guild": "<guild>",
    "channels": {
        "news": "<news>",
        "chat": "<chat>",
        "starred": "<starred>"
    },
    "admins": [
        "<admin1>",
        "<admin2>",
        .
        .
        .
    ],
    "emojis": {
        "curved": "<curved>",
        "straight": "<straight>"
    }
}
```
The bot must be added to an auxiliary server in which the curved and straight emojis are present in order to use replies while cloning
